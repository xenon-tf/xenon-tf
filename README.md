### Hello, I'm xenontetrafluoride.
Yes, the one from Roblox - or wherever else you recognize me from.<br>
I rarely use GitHub, but there are two main reasons why I use it on occasion:
  1. Version control
  2. Open-sourcing

Before using GitHub, I didn't have any version control. This meant I couldn't access old versions of games I made - and worse, I couldn't open-source my work. GitHub, of course, solved both of those problems.

Now, look; as mentioned before, I barely use GitHub, so I'm not a guru. I barely know what I'm doing. I'm just monkeying around and hoping that the end result is any more than worthless. I am very prone to making mistakes. Please don't judge me too harshly if I do something incredibly stupid.
